# Guess the Number Game

# Overview:
This is a Python-based guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game offers three difficulty levels with varying ranges of numbers, allowing players to choose their preferred level of challenge.

# Features:
- **Multiple Difficulty Levels:** Players can select from three difficulty levels:
  - Easy: Numbers range from 1 to 50.
  - Medium: Numbers range from 1 to 100.
  - Hard: Numbers range from 1 to 200.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** The game prompts players to input their guesses and provides feedback after each attempt, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low.
- **Feedback and Results:** Once the player correctly guesses the secret number, the game congratulates them and displays the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.
- **Error Handling:** The game handles invalid inputs gracefully, defaulting to the medium difficulty level if an invalid choice is made.

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the `guess_the_number.py` file in your preferred Python environment.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to select a difficulty level and make guesses until you correctly guess the secret number.
